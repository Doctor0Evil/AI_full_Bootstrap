üõ†Ô∏è Full Example Workflow
5. Bootloader Startup to Plugin Execution Workflow
Power On / Reset

Hardware triggers boot sequence.
MinimalLoader Stage

MinimalLoader.Main()
 runs.
Detects platform (
Platform.Detect()
).
Initializes hardware (
Hardware.Init()
).
Displays boot banner.
Verifies bootloader signature (
Security.VerifyBootSignature()
).
Adapts capabilities (
Capability.Adapt()
).
Launches intermediate loader (
IntermediateLoader.Launch()
).
IntermediateLoader Stage

Sets up memory (
Memory.Setup()
).
Launches main menu shell (
SystemMenuShell.Start()
).
MainLoader / Menu Shell Stage

Builds root menu (
MenuBuilder.BuildRootMenu()
).
Loads and verifies plugins (
PluginManager.LoadPlugins(rootMenu)
).
Plugins register their menu commands.
Displays interactive menu shell (
SystemMenuShell.Start()
).
User navigates menus, executes commands (
CommandExecutor.Execute()
).
Shell enforces security (blocks unauthorized commands).
Plugins execute their logic as commanded.
Runtime Monitoring

Diagnostics collect system metrics continuously.
Logs are written with structured JSON.
Error handler manages exceptions and triggers recovery or reboot.
Shutdown / Reboot

User selects reboot/shutdown from menu.
Plugins shutdown cleanly (
Plugin.Shutdown()
).
System control executes requested action.
üîê Security Policy Documents & Compliance Checklist
6. Security Policy Summary
Authentication

Enforce strong password policies (min length, complexity).
Multi-factor authentication encouraged (hardware root of trust).
Passwords stored hashed with salt (not plaintext).
Boot Integrity

Cryptographic verification of bootloader and plugins.
Secure Boot enforcement halts on signature mismatch.
Plugins verified before loading; unverified plugins rejected.
Command Control

Shell restricts commands to approved whitelist.
Code reproduction commands blocked and logged.
Admin and developer commands protected by role-based access.
Logging & Monitoring

Structured logs with timestamps and context.
Log rotation to prevent disk exhaustion.
Continuous diagnostics and health checks.
Data Protection

Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit.
Access to network/cloud APIs secured with credentials and tokens.
Update & Patch Management

Plugins and bootloader components signed and versioned.
Automatic updates verified before application.
